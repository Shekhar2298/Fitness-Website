        <h2 class="text-primary "><u>Nutrition is important for fitness</u></h2>
        <p>Making the commitment to exercise regularly is a terrific start to getting fit. However, without sound
            nutritional guidance, achieving your goals may be impossible. Tough workouts demand the right kind of fuel —
            and that fuel comes from the foods and beverages you consume.</p>
        <p>In a recent study of

            90,000 people, researchers found that approximately 57.9% of participants' daily calories came from heavily
            refined and processed foods. These are the so-called “convenience foods” that populate the shelves of the
            local supermarket: canned soups, frozen meals, boxed side dishes, soda and snack foods, and so on.</p>
        <p>These are foods that our ancestors would recognize as food: fruit from the tree, vegetables pulled from the
            plant or ground, real meat, poultry, seafood and eggs. If you're serious about personal weight training and
            fitness, you must get serious about your diet, too. Your body is built from both the workouts you complete
            and the foods you eat. The foods you eat provide the macro nutrients — protein, carbohydrates and fats —
            that give you energy to sustain you through your workout and build stronger muscles. The vitamins, minerals,
            antioxidants and fiber found within real, wholesome foods nourishes every cell in your body, providing the
            best fuel for your workouts.</p>
        <p>Proper fitness nutrition begins with understanding what you need to eat, when to eat, and how to maintain
            your eating habits for the long haul. </p>

            <li><b>Keep a food diary:</b>
                A food diary can help you track not just what you eat, but also how much, when
                and where you ate it. Spend just one day writing down what and how much you eat, and how you feel
                after. No cheating! Add up the calorie total the next day. You may be surprised by how many calories
                you consumed.Many free online trackers and apps tally protein, carbohydrate and fat intake, as well
                as how well you meet the RDA for many important vitamins and minerals. It's important to track not
                just your food, but when you ate it, as well.
            </li>


            <li><b>Eat the right food:</b>
                Lean protein, complex carbs and fiber are your best foods, especially if
                you're trying to lose weight. Your body needs lean protein such as turkey, nonfat Greek yogurt, fish
                and egg whites to build muscle and stay full. Complex carbs, such as green leafy vegetables, give
                you energy to burn and fiber fills you up and keeps your digestive system and hormones in
                alignment.Fats should be healthy, mono-saturated fats, such as olive oil, or from plant-based
                sources rich in omega-3 fatty acids. Walnuts, flaxseeds and similar oils, nuts and seeds provide
                healthy fats. </li>


            <li><b>Don't eat the wrong foods:</b>
                Avoid foods that come in boxes and bags ,specially Processed foods usually contain tons of sugar,
                salt and preservatives. </li>


            <li><b>Drink water:</b>
                Drink plenty of fresh, pure water daily, including with meals. Drink about 16 fluid
                ounces, or two cups of water, about two hours before a workout. Sip water throughout your workout.
                If you're working out in hot weather, be sure to drink more water than you think you need. Thirst is
                a sign that your body is slightlydehydrated. Drink to stay ahead of your thirst.</li>


            <li><b>Avoid sugar:</b>
                Sugar can be found in many foods naturally, such as fructose in fruits and
                sweeteners like maple syrup and honey. Refined, white sugar provides fuel and not much else for your
                body's needs. It causes tooth decay and can lead to obesity. Get your sugar from natural treats such
                as a piece of fruit eaten for dessert, and avoid adding sugar to your diet.</li>

        <h3 class="text-info-rgb">1.Carbohydrates</h3>
        <p>carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body and therefore play the most substantial role
            in fueling exercise. There are two different types of carbohydrates i.e. complex and simple.</p>
        <p> complex carbohydrates provide the body with prolonged slow-release of energy and have a great
            nutritional benefit. While simple carbohydrates provide the body with a short-term, fast releasing
            energy, they contain little nutritional value.</p>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/images-prod.healthline.com/hlcmsresource/images/AN_images/indian-diet-weight-loss-1296x728-feature.jpg?w=1155&h=1528"
            class="nutri-img3">
        <h3 class="text--bs-info-rgb">2.Protein</h3>
        <p>Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids, the building blocks of protein. When we digest protein
            from foods or drinks, these are broken down to amino acids. The body then builds all the different
            proteins it needs from these amino acids.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Eggs:</b> Eggs are a good source of protein and also provide omega 3 fats, vitamin A, B vitamins,
                vitamin D
                and selenium. There is no limit on how many eggs you can eat as part of a healthy varied diet
                (unless a health professional advises you to limit eggs due to a specific health condition).Egg
                whites contain plenty of protein power without the fat and cholesterol of the yolks, the yellow part
                in the center. Egg protein has a BV of 100.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Meat:</b>

                Meat and poultry are good sources of protein as well as different vitamins and minerals. Poultry
                like chicken provides B vitamins, phosphorus and selenium and can be low in fat if you choose
                chicken breast without skin.Although they can be high in fat, leaner cuts — baked instead of fried —
                all provide a good source of protein in the diet. Fish can also add protein.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Plants:</b>There are indeed some vegetarian weight lifters who are strong and fit and consume
                only plant protein. Plants do contain protein, but in much lower concentrations than animal food.
                Beans combined with whole grains, such as rice or quinoa, provide plenty of protein. Nuts and seeds
                are also high in protein, although they are also high in fat. Unprocessed nuts and seeds are best
                for healthy eating so that you avoid excess salt and fat added during roasting.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-info-rgb">3.Fats</h3>
        <p>While fats can have a positive impact on health, there are several types of fat some of which are of
            greater benefit than others in gym diet plans. Recently studies have shown that saturated fats are not
            as harmful as once believed, you should mainly focus primarily on unsaturated fats.</p>

        <p> Examples of unsaturated fat foods include avocados, seeds, nuts, peanut butter, fish (salmon, tuna,
            mackerel), oils (olive, peanut), and soy products that you can include in your gym diet plan.</p>

    <main class="container">
        <h2 class="text-warning"><u>An Action Plan</u></h2>
        <p>Nutrition with personal training is perhaps the best way to get into shape. Understanding what you need to
            eat and how much to eat is a great start to reach your goals. From there, balancing your nutrition with the
            right intake of protein, fat and carbohydrates will help you reach for Excellence In Fitness.Action

        <ul>
            <li>Writing down what you eat, how much you ate and when you ate it in a food diary .</li>
            <li>Figuring out how many calories you need to eat to maintain, gain or lose weight.</li>
            <li>Weighing and measuring your food to adjust portion sizes and ensure you're not eating too much at meal
                times.</li>
            <li>Switching from refined foods to unrefined foods.</li>
            <li>Drinking more water instead of sugary juices, sodas (even diet sodas) and alcoholic drinks.</li>
            <li>After weight training workouts, to boost muscle recovery and build muscles faster take in protein rich
                foods such as lean meats or eggs.</li>
            <li>Seeing how you feel after you make dietary changes. After all, these are changes for a lifetime — not
                just to train for an event. You won't stick with them if they don't feel good.</li>
            <li>Assessing your progress over time. Are the changes working? If not, what can you change in your diet to
                achieve your goal?</li>


        </ul>
       
        <P>Eat the best-quality foods you can afford, supplement with protein and drink plenty of fresh water. Avoid
            salt, refined sugar and alcohol. Get plenty of sleep and fresh air, and you'll support your body as it
            transforms into your desired fitness leve</P>
