        <h1 class="text-warning" style="font-size: 60px;">YOGA</h1>
        <h5 class="text-info" style="font-size: 30px;">Yoga can help soothe the mind and lower stress levels. It does
            this by focusing the mind on the moment and
            the movements. Increase your concentration. A main part of yoga is rhythmic, focused breathing.</h5>
    </div><br>
    <div class="container ">
        <h1>What is yoga and how does it work? </h1>
        <p>Yoga is an ancient and complex practice, rooted in Indian philosophy. It began as a spiritual practice but
            has become popular as a way of promoting physical and mental well-being.</p>

        <p> Although classical yoga also includes other elements, yoga as practiced in the United States typically
            emphasizes physical postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama), and meditation (dyana).</p>

        <p> There are many different yoga styles, ranging from gentle practices to physically demanding ones.
            Differences in the types of yoga used in research studies may affect study results. This makes it
            challenging to evaluate research on the health effects of yoga.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of yoga</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Help improve general wellness by relieving stress, supporting good health habits, and improving
                mental/emotional health, sleep, and balance.</li>
            <li>Relieve low-back pain and neck pain, and possibly pain from tension-type headaches and knee
                osteoarthritis.</li>
            <li>Help people who are overweight or obese lose weight.</li>
            <li>Help people manage anxiety or depressive symptoms associated with difficult life situations.</li>
            <li>Help people with chronic diseases manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>What are the risks of yoga?</h2>
        <p>Yoga is generally considered a safe form of physical activity for healthy people when performed properly,
            under the guidance of a qualified instructor. However, as with other forms of physical activity, injuries
            can occur. The most common injuries are sprains and strains, and the parts of the body most commonly injured
            are the knee or lower leg. Serious injuries are rare. The risk of injury associated with yoga is lower than
            that for higher impact physical activities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Types of Yoga</h2>

        <p>There are four fundamental types of Yoga - Karma Yoga, Gnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Kriya Yoga. This is
            because a human being is a combination of these four aspects - Body, Mind, Emotion, and Energy. Whatever
            kind of spiritual path one walks falls into one or more of these four categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gnana Yoga:</b>Gnana Yoga is the path of intelligence. Sadhguru describes it as a process of
                sharpening
                one's intelligence to a point where it penetrates through the process of life and shows you what is true
                and what is not true.</li><br>
            <li><b>Karma Yoga:</b>
                Karma Yoga is the path of selfless action. It is the path of service, where one uses physical action to
                evolve spiritually.</li><br>
            <li> <b>Bhakti Yoga</b>
                Bhakti Yoga is the path of devotion, where one uses their emotions to try to reach the ultimate.
                Sadhguru describes this path as the fastest and sweetest way to grow.</li><br>
            <li><b>Kriya Yoga</b>
                Kriya Yoga is the path of using one's inner energies to reach the ultimate. Following the path of pure
                Kriya Yoga is a very demanding but powerful way to walk the spiritual path.</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>Types of Poses</h2>
        <p>Yoga has various pose types based on how you move your body to complete them. Here are the basic types of
            yoga poses.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Standing poses:</b> Standing poses are often done first in a yoga class to "build heat" and warm you
                up.</li><br>
            <li><b>Balancing poses:</b> Beginners' balances are an important way to build the core strength necessary
                for many
                of yoga's more advanced postures. Though balances may seem difficult at first, you will find that you
                can improve markedly with regular practice.</li><br>
            <li><b>Backbends:</b> As a beginner, you will generally begin with gentle spine flexion and extension,
                eventually
                moving to deeper bends. Since you rarely move like this in daily life, backbends are essential for
                spinal health and longevity.</li><br>
            <li><b>Seated poses:</b> Seated stretches, which often focus on stretching the hips and hamstrings, are
                usually
                done toward the end of a yoga class after the body is warm. Placing a folded blanket or a block under
                your seat is an excellent way to make yourself more comfortable in these postures.
            </li><br>
            <li><b>Resting or supine poses:</b> It's essential to get to know your resting poses, especially child's
                pose,
                which you are encouraged to do whenever you need a break during a yoga session. These resting poses
                continue the hip and hamstring work of the seated poses and provide gentle back-bending, twisting, and
                inversion.</li><br>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <img style="display: block;margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;width: 50%;"
            src="Resources\images\types-of-yoga-asanas.jpg">
        <h2>TYPE OF ASANAS </h2>
        <P>The asanas are poses mainly for health and strength. There are innumerable asanas, but not all of them are
            really necessary, I shall deal with only such asanas as are useful in curing ailments and maintaining good
            health. </P>
        <li><b>ARDHA CHAKRSANA (HALF WHEEL POSTURE):</b>

        <li><b>TRIKONASANA(TRIANGLE POSTURE):</b>

        <li><b>VEERABHADRASANA -2:</b>

            'Veera Bhadra' is one of the Gana (can call as Soldier) of Lord Shiva. This pose dedicated to him, so this

        <li><b>PARSHWA KONASANA (SIDE ANGLE POSTURE):</b>
            In Sanskrit 'Parshwa' means Side, 'Kona' means angle. In the final position of this posture, the body forms
            a side angle, so this posture called as Parshwa Konasana.</li><br>
        <li><b>BHUJANGAASANA:</b>
            The final position of this posture emulates the action of cobra raising itself just prior to striking at its
            prey, so it's called cobra posture or Bhujangasan.</li><br>
        <li><b>PADAHASTASANA:</b>
            "Pada" means foot, "hasta" means hand. So the exact English translation is the foot hand pose. This asana
            widely called as the forward bending posture.</li><br>
        <li><b>USTRASANA:</b>

            Paschima means back or west, 'uttana' means to stretch, in this posture back stretches nicely, so-called

        <li><b>PAVANA MUKTASANA:</b>
            In Sanskrit 'Pawan' means wind, 'Mukta' means release. This posture is very useful in removing wind from the
