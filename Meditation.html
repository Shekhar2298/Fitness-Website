        <h1>Meditation for beginners</h1>
    </div>




    <div class="container">
        <h2>History of Meditation</h2>
        <p>While meditation has recently grown in popularity in the U.S., the practice actually dates back thousands of
            years. The practice has been associated with religious traditions, particularly Buddhism. Meditation was
            used throughout Asia but finally began to make its way to other parts of the world during the 20th century.
            It rose to prominence in the West during the 1960s and 1970s and was often associated with hippie culture.

            In addition to its association with Buddhism, meditation is also practiced in Christianity, Islam, Hinduism,
            and Taoism. However, it is important to note that a person does not need to be religious to meditate. Guided
            meditation and transcendental meditation are two examples of non-religious forms of meditation. Yoga can
            also be a non-religious form of physical meditation.</p>




        <h2>What is meditation?</h2>
        <p>Meditation is the practice of intentionally spending time with our mind. We take time out of our busy days to
            sit, breathe, and try to remain focused on our breath. Doing this helps us become more aware of our
            thoughts,
            act more compassionately toward ourselves and others, and connect with the present moment.</p>

        <h2>What does meditation do?</h2>
        <p>Life is sometimes difficult, stressful, and challenging. We can't control what happens, but we do have the
            potential to change the way we relate to those things. We need awareness to understand our own mind (our
            thoughts, feelings, and behaviors). And we need compassion to connect with ourselves and others.</p>
        <p>Meditation creates the conditions for us to see things more clearly, feel calmer and content, and be kind to
            ourselves and others no matter what's happening in our lives. But that doesn't mean we'll feel clear, calm,
            and kind as soon as we start or finish. Since the mind is always changing, our experience might feel
            different each time we meditate.</p>

        <h2>Start meditating?</h2>
        <ul class="list1">
            <li><b>What matters most is consistency.</b>
                Ideally, we meditate a few times a week or daily. But even completing one meditation can lead to a
                reduction in mind wandering. We'll feel more and more benefits the more we practice. Research shows that
                30 days of Headspace reduces stress by a third and improves satisfaction with life.</li>

            <li><b>The best time to meditate is whenever we can.</b>It doesn't matter when (or where) we meditate, so
                choose whatever time works best. Meditation could be nice to do first thing in the morning before our
                day begins or at night in bed. We could always meditate to reset ourselves before our last work meeting
                or after we drop the kids off at school. Anytime we feel overwhelmed, we can take a break and meditate
                instead of pushing through.</li>
            <li><b>We only need a few minutes to meditate.</b>A short meditation can be five minutes or less. If we feel
                like that's not enough, a 10-minute meditation is great for beginners. Once we have a consistent
                practice, we can slowly increase our time.</li>
            <li><b>Be prepared for noisy distractions.</b>We don't need perfect quiet to meditate. Total silence might
                be too overwhelming in meditation for beginners. We become extra sensitive to every little sound when
                things are completely quiet.</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Types of Meditation</h2>
        <p>Meditation can take on many different forms, but there are two main types: concentrative meditation and
            mindfulness meditation:</p>
        <h3>Concentrative Meditation</h3>
        <p>Concentrative meditation involves focusing on a specific thing while tuning out everything else around you.
            The goal is to experience whatever you are focusing on, whether it's your breath, a specific word, or a
            mantra, to reach a higher state of being</p>
        <h3>Mindfulness Meditation</h3>
        <li>Mindfulness meditation includes, among others, both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and
            mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Mindfulness can target different issues, such as depression,
            meaning its focus may differ from practice to practice. Overall, it involves the state of being aware of and
            involved in the present moment and making yourself open, aware, and accepting. </li>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>Benifits of Meditation</h2>
        <p>Consciousness is often likened to a stream, shifting and changing smoothly as it passes over the terrain.
            Meditation is one deliberate means of changing the course of this stream, and in turn, altering how you
            perceive and respond to the world around you.

            Research has shown that meditation can have both physiological and psychological effects. Some positive
            physiological effects include a lowered state of physical arousal, reduced respiration rate, decreased heart
            rate, changes in brain wave patterns, and lowered stress.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Better management of symptoms related to anxiety disorders, depression, sleep disorders, pain issues,
                and high blood pressure</li>
            <li>Better stress management skills</li>
            <li>Changes in different aspects of attention and mindfulness</li>
            <li>Increased self-awareness</li>
            <li>Improved emotional well-being</li>
            <li>Improved working memory and fluid intelligence</li>
            <li>Improved immunity</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Tips for Meditating</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Start slow.</b> Begin by doing short sessions of around 5 to 10 minutes a day, and then work your way
                up
                progressively to longer sessions.</li>
            <li><b>Set a schedule.</b>Try meditating at the same time each day—for a few minutes first thing in the
                morning, for example.</li>
            <li><b>Get comfortable. </b>Sitting cross-legged on the floor is one option, but comfort is the key. You
                need to be in a position where you can sit for several minutes without getting uncomfortable, stiff, or
                restless.</li>
            <li><b>Focus on what you're feeling.</b>Breathe naturally and notice the feelings and sensations you
                experience as you breathe in and out.</li>
            <li><b>Don't try to suppress feelings. </b>Your mind is bound to wander as you meditate—and sometimes this
                can lead to thoughts and feelings that are uncomfortable or even distressing. The goal isn't to clear
                your mind of such thoughts. What you should think about instead is acknowledging these thoughts without
                judging them, and then gently guiding your focus back toward your breathing.</li>
